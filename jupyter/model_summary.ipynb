Bandwidth is the rate at which data can be read or written (stored) from/to memory by different hardware (e.g. measured as bytes/sec).  Throughput is a measure of the data that actually moves (read/stored) in a period of time (bytes/sec).<br>\n",
    "Because the amount of data required for a typical neural-network operation is often larger than the available working memory of the compute hardware (e.g. CPU registers and cache), data often needs to be sliced into tiles (blocks).  The sizes of the tiles, together with the memory access pattern and the compute algorithm, determine the total amount of data that needs to move around (read/stored).  Because of this hardware dependency, we provide below information regarding memory footprint and not throughput."
