# Training baseline networks

The term *baseline-networks* refers to the trained FP32 networks (models) that we use in compression.  We use the performance of these networks as the baseline results to which we compare the performance of our compression algorithms.

This directory contains YAML schedule files that explain:
1. How we trained our baseline-networks (we provide the command-line we used); and
2. Contain the performance results of these networks.  

We provide these files for the purpose of reproducibility and documentation.
