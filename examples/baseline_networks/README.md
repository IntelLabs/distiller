# Training baseline networks

The term baseline networks refers to the trained FP32 networks (models) that we use in compression.

Besides their use in some algorithms, we also use the performance of these networks as the baseline results to which we compare the results of our compression algorithms.

This directory contains YAML schedule files, which contain the command-line and the performance results.  You can use these files to train your own baseline networks.
