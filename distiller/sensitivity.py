"""Perform sensitivity tests on layers and whole networks.

Construct a schedule for experimenting with network and layer sensitivity
to pruning.

The idea is to set the pruning level (percentage) of specific layers (or the
entire network), and then to prune once, run an evaluation on the test dataset,
and exit.  This should teach us about the "sensitivity" of the network/layers
to pruning.

This concept is discussed in "Learning both Weights and Connections for
Efficient Neural Networks" - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02626v3.pdf

    """Perform a sensitivity test for a model's weights parameters.

    The model should be trained to maximum accuracy, because we aim to understand
    the behavior of the model's performance in relation to pruning of a specific
    weights tensor.

    By default this function will test all of the model's parameters.

    The return value is a complex sensitivities dictionary: the dictionary's
    key is the name (string) of the weights tensor.  The value is another dictionary,
    where the tested sparsity-level is the key, and a (top1, top5, loss) tuple
    is the value.
    Below is an example of such a dictionary:

    .. code-block:: python
    {'features.module.6.weight':    {0.0:  (56.518, 79.07,  1.9159),
                                     0.05: (56.492, 79.1,   1.9161),
                                     0.10: (56.212, 78.854, 1.9315),
                                     0.15: (35.424, 60.3,   3.0866)},
     'classifier.module.1.weight':  {0.0:  (56.518, 79.07,  1.9159),
                                     0.05: (56.514, 79.07,  1.9159),
                                     0.10: (56.434, 79.074, 1.9138),
                                     0.15: (54.454, 77.854, 2.3127)} }

    The test_func is expected to execute the model on a test/validation dataset,
    and return the results for top1 and top5 accuracies, and the loss value.
